I created an array where each index represents an x value.  The values of each index are expressed within an array to represent y values.  The array representing y values, uses the index to represent the y value, with the value representing the pixel located at that location.  This ensures that all x and y values can be filled without being overwritten by the value of a different y value with the same x.
